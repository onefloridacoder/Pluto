This repo houses the PoCs I'm working through currently to understand what Azure has become.  I created many Azure solutions about 7 years ago (pre-Gu taking the helm) and it has matured, changed - as has the tooling.

Many of these sub-projects are brute force efforts to build and app and expose it differently (VM vs. Azure App Service, etc.)
